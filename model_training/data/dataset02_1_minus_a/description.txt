This is a test dataset produced with six conditions:

    {sig: constant_signal, noise: 0.0},
    {sig: constant_signal, noise: 0.04},
    {sig: sinusoidal_signal, noise: 0.0},
    {sig: sinusoidal_signal, noise: 0.04},
    {sig: triangular_signal, noise: 0.0},
    {sig: triangular_signal, noise: 0.04}

performing 500 simulations for each case, 500 samples for each simulation.
The parasite capacitance has also been varies in length.

The input data is normalized, between 0.0 and 1.0. It is recommended to 
transform the data into the range -1.0, 1.0 so it is easier for the model to
learn from it. The output data is not normalized at all.
